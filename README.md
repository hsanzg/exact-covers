Let $I$ be a set of _items_. Given a collection $\mathcal{O}$ of subsets of $I$,
an _exact cover_ of $I$ is a subcollection $\mathcal{O}^\star$ of $\mathcal{O}$
such that each item in $I$ appears in exactly one _option_ in $\mathcal{O}^\star$.
The goal of an exact cover problem is to find one such subset of options
$\mathcal{O}^\star$.

D. E. Knuth proposed a method for solving the exact cover problem in the paper
[_Dancing Links_][dl], whose title refers to a clever yet simple technique
technique for deleting and restoring the nodes of a doubly linked list.
His backtracking algorithm, called _Algorithm X_, employs this "waltzing"
of links to visit all exact covers of $I$ with options $\mathcal{O}$ in
a recursive, depth-first manner. For further information, see Section 7.2.2.1
of [_The Art of Computer Programming_, Volume 4B, Part 2][taocp4b] (Addison-Wesley,
2022).

A slight modification to this procedure solves the considerably more general
problem in which items fall into one of two categories: _primary_ items,
which _must_ be covered by exactly one option in $\mathcal{O}^\star$, and
_secondary_ items, which _can_ be in at most one option of $\mathcal{O}^\star$.
This crate contains various implementations of Knuth's exact cover solvers
and their data structures in the Rust programming language:
- [`ExactCovers`] finds all exact coverings of $I$ with options in $\mathcal{O}$
  under the assumption that every option contains at least one primary item.
- [`ColoredExactCovers`] will solve the exact cover problem with color constraints.

Also, the [`examples`] directory contains an instructive set of programs that
apply these algorithms to a variety of problems:
- [`langford_pairs.rs`] finds all [Langford pairings] of $2n$ numbers.
- [`polycube_packing.rs`] computes the number of ways to arrange 25 [Y pentacubes]
  in a $5\times 5\times 5$ cuboid. R. Honsberger's book [_Mathematical Gems II_][mgems]
  (1976), Chapter 8, provides a good introduction to the techniques for solving
  polycube packing puzzles.
